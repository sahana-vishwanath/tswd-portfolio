Come along on my journey ~

## About me
My name is Sahana Vishwanath and my pronouns are she/her. I'm currently a Master's student at CMU at the Integrated Innovation Institute and will be graduating in December of 2024. I am originally from the Bay Area in California, then moved to Seattle for undergrad where I studied Human-Centered Design and Engineering at the University of Washington. I then moved to Boston where I worked as a front-end software engineer for a couple years, and finally moved to Pittsburgh and here I am! Outside of school and work, I love to dance, read, watch TV and movies, and walk around exploring new places.

## What I hope to learn
I am very interested in human behavior and specifically UX research, and within this field, it is important to be able to effectively communicate and display findings and insights. The main thing I am hoping to learn in this class is to me better communicate my research data, findings, and insights in a visually stimulating, creative, and effective way.
