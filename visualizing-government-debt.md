# Assignment 1: Visualizing government debt using Tableau

## Part 1: Working with web-based visualization tools and data
I started this assignment by exploring the data set I would be working with, which was this [General Government Debt](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm) data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). To explore how to incorporate visualizations into GitHub pages, I added the following visualization from the OECD's website.

<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/7kiR" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/7kiR" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2015</a></iframe>

## Part 2: Working with Tableau
After exploring the data in OECD, I imported the data set into Tableau. The following visualization was instructer-led, and allowed me the opportunity to explore Tableau and better understand the features and functionality of the application.

  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1706398342573');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  vizElement.style.width='100%';
  vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                   
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

## Part 3: Create your own visualization
For this final part, I created my own visualization. The following visualization displays the range of general government debt in European countries from 1995-2022. Each European country is represented by a box-and-whisker plot, with the extremes represented by the horizontal lines towards the end. By hovering over various points on the chart, you can see what year each data point corresponds to. From the chart you can see the leftmost country, Greece, had the largest range in debt, and as you move to the right, the range gets smaller and smaller.

<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1706588234984');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

## Part 4: Overall Reflection
I think it's interesting to see how all three of the visualizations on this page utilize the same dataset but present in different ways. The first visualization allows viewers to focus on one specific year, and understand general debt for all available countries. Since this chart is sorted, you can clearly see which countries had the highest/lowest debt, and the highlighting of the average in a darker color allows the viewer to separate the countries into two different halves. The chart is not overly busy, and the horizontal gridlines assist viewers to approximately understand the debt for each bar. I think this chart would be most useful when exploring specifically into debt in the year 2015.

The second visualization is much more broad compared to the prior. It shows the entire dataset, including all available countries from 1995 to 2022. I think the amount of information on this chart is a little overwhelming, however the use of color allows viewers to focus on certain areas rather than be overwhelmed by the amount of information. Like the previous chart, the sorting for this visualization is very helpful to see the countries with higher/lower debt. I find this visualization harder to read than the first one, since there is a lot more data, however I think it serves the purpose of providing viewers with a quick visual snapshot of the overall dataset very well. 

After creating the visualization from Part 2, I wanted to be better able to understand how each country's debt has changed over the time span of 1995-2022. I decided to choose to use box-and-whisker plots for this reason, so that it would help viewers visualize the range, and they would be able to compare the range country by country. I also have never used a box-and-whisker plot chart before, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to explore and try it out. I initially created the chart with every country included, however I felt it was too much information and was quite overwhelming, so I decided to reduce the data to only European countries. I also wanted to make sure that I sorted the data from left to right, decreasing by size of the range since it would be difficult to directly compare two ranges that were very similar in size. I initially wanted to use diverging colors similar to the ones chosen in the previous chart, however, I wanted to use the same color range for both the data point circles and the box. Within Tableau, I was only able to select options of singular colors for the box-and-whisker plots, so to make sure the data points matched the boxes, I used a one color gradient. I think this visualization combines elements of the first two, in that it is a smaller amount of data so it a little more streamlined and easier to absorb at once, while also including data over a large period of time. I believe this chart is able to effectively convey which European countries had the most variance in debt from 1995-2022, which is not as easily understandable in the chart from visualization 2 and is not visible at all in visualization 1.
