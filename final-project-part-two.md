# First Draft: Wireframes and storyflow

Over the past few decades, the United States has witnessed a significant decline in its fertility rate, marking a transformative shift in demographic trends. This downward trajectory, characterized by fewer births per woman, has emerged as a multifaceted phenomenon influenced by various societal, economic, and cultural factors.

</script>

Callout statistic: From 2017 to 2019, 10 percent of American women ages 15 to 44 said they had received some form of fertility service.

Infertility casts a wide-reaching shadow across the diverse landscape of the United States, impacting individuals and couples from every corner of the nation. Regardless of geographic location, socioeconomic status, or cultural background, the struggle to conceive can evoke profound emotional, psychological, and financial burdens.

Infertility manifests through a diverse array of causes, with prevalence varying across demographics and regions. Factors such as age, lifestyle, genetics, and underlying health conditions can significantly influence the likelihood of experiencing fertility challenges.

Rural areas across the United States face a significant disparity in access to assisted reproductive technology (ART) clinics compared to urban counterparts, exacerbating the healthcare divide. Limited infrastructure, sparse populations, and a shortage of specialized medical professionals contribute to the scarcity of ART clinics in rural regions. As a result, individuals and couples residing in these areas often encounter formidable barriers when seeking fertility treatments, including lengthy travel distances and increased financial burdens. The lack of nearby clinics not only hampers access to essential reproductive health services but also amplifies feelings of isolation and frustration among rural residents struggling with infertility.

The geographical distance between patients and specialized infertility services and ART centers often results in delayed access to care, particularly affecting female patients with diminished ovarian reserve. Such delays can exacerbate their condition, further reducing their chances of successful treatment. Similarly, conditions like endometriosis and fibroids may suffer from postponed diagnosis and intervention, adding to the fertility challenges faced by individuals. For male factor infertility patients, abnormal sperm parameters may indicate underlying medical issues such as testicular cancer or endocrinopathy, highlighting the integral role of fertility care within comprehensive medical practice.

A recent study by Pew Research highlights the disparities in IVF accessibility across regions, underscoring the impact of insurance mandates for infertility coverage. States with robust mandates exhibit a significantly higher proportion of births resulting from ART. In contrast, states lacking such coverage, including New Mexico, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, and West Virginia, witness ART births comprising less than 1% of total births.

To address these disparities, low-cost fertility centers have emerged, focusing on simplified embryo culture techniques and offering a more limited range of ART services. The Walking Egg Project exemplifies this approach, outlining a model for establishing new practices. Some clinics have even introduced mobile units for testing and monitoring, aiming to reach patients in remote areas. However, rural patients who do access care often lack a local support system of individuals with ART experience, exacerbating the emotional toll of fertility treatment. Moreover, the financial burden of traveling long distances for care, including expenses like lodging, transportation, and lost wages, further underscores the need for equitable access to fertility services.


# User research 

## Target audience
I do not have a very specific audience for my research - women tend to be more aware of infertility, however, I think it is important for men to learn more and be more aware of these struggles as well. I am hoping my research helps bring awareness, and help chip away, even if just marginally, at the taboo of infertility and start a conversatino. For my research, I am planning to approach both men and women, and I am curious to see if/how their responses differ.

# Color Palette
<!-- Coolors Palette Widget -->
<script src="https://coolors.co/palette-widget/widget.js"></script>
<script data-id="020967923891515494">new CoolorsPaletteWidget("020967923891515494", ["f07e38","fef9ff","596869","e5f993","8cc084"]); </script>

The current color palette that I want to work with is displayed above. Orange is the color used for infertility awareness, and is the main highlight color I plan to use. I wanted to have an off-white and grey color in my palette as supplementary colors, and then the pineapple is also highly associated with infertility, so I wanted to include a light yellow and green shade to pull that in. I am not entirely sure how much yellow and green I will be able to implement, and if it would take too much away from the orange, but I plan to play with this through my wireframes and user research testing.
