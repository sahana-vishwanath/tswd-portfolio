# First Draft: Wireframes and storyflow

Over the past few decades, the United States has witnessed a significant decline in its fertility rate, marking a transformative shift in demographic trends. This downward trajectory, characterized by fewer births per woman, has emerged as a multifaceted phenomenon influenced by various societal, economic, and cultural factors.

Callout statistic: From 2017 to 2019, 10 percent of American women ages 15 to 44 said they had received some form of fertility service.

Infertility affects millions of individuals and couples across the United States, and is a significant yet often overlooked aspect of reproductive health. There is a large stigma around infertility, and it tends to be a topic that is not openly discussed in society since many couples, especially women, feel ashamed and insecure about the struggles they face. Regardless of geographic location, socioeconomic status, or cultural background, the struggle to conceive can evoke profound emotional, psychological, and financial burdens.

Infertility manifests through a diverse array of causes, with prevalence varying across demographics and regions. Factors such as age, lifestyle, genetics, and underlying health conditions can significantly influence the likelihood of experiencing fertility challenges.

Rural areas across the United States face a significant disparity in access to assisted reproductive technology (ART) clinics compared to urban counterparts, exacerbating the healthcare divide. Limited infrastructure, sparse populations, and a shortage of specialized medical professionals contribute to the scarcity of ART clinics in rural regions. As a result, individuals and couples residing in these areas often encounter formidable barriers when seeking fertility treatments, including lengthy travel distances and increased financial burdens. The lack of nearby clinics not only hampers access to essential reproductive health services but also amplifies feelings of isolation and frustration among rural residents struggling with infertility.

The geographical distance between patients and specialized infertility services and ART centers often results in delayed access to care, particularly affecting female patients with diminished ovarian reserve. Such delays can exacerbate their condition, further reducing their chances of successful treatment. Similarly, conditions like endometriosis and fibroids may suffer from postponed diagnosis and intervention, adding to the fertility challenges faced by individuals. For male factor infertility patients, abnormal sperm parameters may indicate underlying medical issues such as testicular cancer or endocrinopathy, highlighting the integral role of fertility care within comprehensive medical practice.

A recent study by Pew Research highlights the disparities in IVF accessibility across regions, underscoring the impact of insurance mandates for infertility coverage. States with robust mandates exhibit a significantly higher proportion of births resulting from ART. In contrast, states lacking such coverage, including New Mexico, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, and West Virginia, witness ART births comprising less than 1% of total births.

To address these disparities, low-cost fertility centers have emerged, focusing on simplified embryo culture techniques and offering a more limited range of ART services. The Walking Egg Project exemplifies this approach, outlining a model for establishing new practices. Some clinics have even introduced mobile units for testing and monitoring, aiming to reach patients in remote areas. However, rural patients who do access care often lack a local support system of individuals with ART experience, exacerbating the emotional toll of fertility treatment. Moreover, the financial burden of traveling long distances for care, including expenses like lodging, transportation, and lost wages, further underscores the need for equitable access to fertility services.

Call to action:
1. Don't shy away from this topic! Help break down the stigma and shame behind infertility
2. Support organizations like the Walking Egg Project to help improve accessibility to infertility care

# User research 

## Target audience
I do not have a very specific audience for my research - women tend to be more aware of infertility, however, I think it is important for men to learn more and be more aware of these struggles as well. I am hoping my research helps bring awareness, and help chip away, even if just marginally, at the taboo of infertility and start a conversatino. For my research, I am planning to approach both men and women, and I am curious to see if/how their responses differ.

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|  Clarity of visualizations    |          Were you able to quickly understand each of the visualizations? Did you understand the purpose of each visualization? Was there anything you felt was confusing in the visualizations?     |
|   Clear story   |        Were there any points in the story that felt disconnected to you? Did the story seem to flow?  |
|   Spark curiousity   |  Did you feel interested or curious about this topic after? Where there things you were left wondering about?   |


## Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview 1: South-Asian, mid-20s, Female | Interview 2: Asian, early-30s, Male | Interview 3: South-Asian American, late 20s, Female |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Clarity of visualizations questions | Visuals were easy to understand quickly, Was curious about the choice of the color orange      |     Liked the country map visuals especially, was confused about if population size was accounting for in the first country map visual        |   Liked the current visuals, wanted to see more visual information specifically about the lack of clinics in rural areas          |
|          Clear story questions               |       Story flowed well, thought the of causes was excessive and maybe just to include top 5-6                    |     Felt the jump from causes of infertility to the country map of clinics felt a little disjointed, but could be fixed by adding a callout statistic or something similar        |       Not too much feedback, felt the story flowed well for the most part but could work on it a little more     |
|     Spark curiosity questions                    |      Loved this topic, was intersted in learning more specifically about the Walking Egg Project                          |     Didn't know a lot of information about the topic, and was open to learn more        |   Very aware of infertility and brought up recent news about IVF case in Alabama that I could potentially mention/include in my story, once again wanted to see more about the lack of rural clinics and maybe show a visual here to visually display the number difference          |


# Identified changes for Part III


| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lack of visuals about rural clinics | Add an inforgraphic, or small visual showing the data about the rural clincs rather than a lot of text. I think once I transition to Shorthand this will be a little easier since I will be able to play around with the background pictures more. |
|    Connect from one visual to the next better                            |   I think I want to work on the wording between visuals a little more to make sure there is a clear transition between each section.  |
|   Add in total population to Infertility Rate per State visual                                       |      When discussing with my interviewee, I realized how misleading this visual currently is since it is just showing that the states with the highest population have the highest number of infertility cases. I plan to add Census data of state populations so that this visual shows the rate of infertility per state rather than just the number.                                                                           |
|    Cut down on causes of infertility table                                      |   Like my interviwee said, this table feels quite long and is too much to look at so I plan to bring the number of causes down to 5 or 6.    |
| Finalize clinic map visual | My interviewees did not mention any critiques on this visual, however I want to work on it a little more to try to emphasize that the current clinics are focused in urban areas. |


I think overall interviewees were interested in my topic and the story I told, however there is more I can do to make the overall story feel more seamless and flow better.


# Color Palette
<!-- Coolors Palette Widget -->
<script src="https://coolors.co/palette-widget/widget.js"></script>
<script data-id="020967923891515494">new CoolorsPaletteWidget("020967923891515494", ["f07e38","fef9ff","596869","e5f993","8cc084"]); </script>

The current color palette that I want to work with is displayed above. Orange is the color used for infertility awareness, and is the main highlight color I plan to use. I wanted to have an off-white and grey color in my palette as supplementary colors, and then the pineapple is also highly associated with infertility, so I wanted to include a light yellow and green shade to pull that in. I am not entirely sure how much yellow and green I will be able to implement, and if it would take too much away from the orange, but I plan to play with this through my wireframes and user research testing.
