# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
I do not have a very specific audience for my research - women tend to be more aware of infertility, however, I think it is important for men to learn more and be more aware of these struggles as well. I am hoping my research helps bring awareness, and help chip away, even if just marginally, at the taboo of infertility and start a conversatino. For my research, I am planning to approach both men and women, and I am curious to see if/how their responses differ.

# Color Palette
<!-- Coolors Palette Widget -->
<script src="https://coolors.co/palette-widget/widget.js"></script>
<script data-id="020967923891515494">new CoolorsPaletteWidget("020967923891515494", ["f07e38","fef9ff","596869","e5f993","8cc084"]); </script>

The current color palette that I want to work with is displayed above. Orange is the color used for infertility awareness, and is the main highlight color I plan to use. I wanted to have an off-white and grey color in my palette as supplementary colors, and then the pineapple is also highly associated with infertility, so I wanted to include a light yellow and green shade to pull that in. I am not entirely sure how much yellow and green I will be able to implement, and if it would take too much away from the orange, but I plan to play with this through my wireframes and user research testing.
